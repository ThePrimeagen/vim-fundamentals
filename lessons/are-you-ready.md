At this point I hope you are ready.  But I wanted to take a moment to let you
know three things.

* This is a journey, its not a day trip
* The journey is uphill
* The top of the mountain is incredible

### For the live class
I stream on twitch, so feel free to ask questions at any point and I can pivot
if its beneficial for all or I'll answer the question at the end of the
section.

### Proper Github projects

1. Clone this presentation project down and open up the files, or go to the
   website and use the curl commands to open up vim.  I recommend just going to
   the website.

2. git clone https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/vim-nav-playground.git

### Clean your environment
If you use vim, remove your vimrc and any plugins.  We are going bare bones and
working our way up.

There is a basic script to stash and restore your vim env in vim-nav-playground
in the tools folder.
